<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

This project is a responsive Testimonial Page designed to display user feedback in an elegant layout with flexible styling. The page contains two sections:

A left section introducing the "Reviewers" concept and listing useful resources.
A right section showcasing testimonials from two major companies: Google and Meta.

- Semantic HTML: Structured the document with proper HTML5 semantics to enhance readability and accessibility.

### Useful resources
